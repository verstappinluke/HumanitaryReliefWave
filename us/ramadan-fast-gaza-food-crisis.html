                                            <p><em>By Mohamad Alasmar, Humanitary Relief Wave’s Advocacy and Resource
                                                    Mobilisation Director for Middle East, North Africa and Eastern
                                                    Europe</em></p>

                                            <p>Every year when the sun sets during Ramadan, Muslims break our fast with
                                                a date – just as the Prophet Mohammed did.</p>

                                            <p>But this Ramadan
                                                in Gaza, where lack of food is forcing families to eat leaves and animal
                                                food to survive, there
                                                will be no dates to break the fast. Date harvesting, along with other
                                                food production, has been completely decimated. And as part of their
                                                restrictions on aid crossing into the Strip, Israeli authorities
                                                are reportedly classifying dates as “dual-use” items
                                                – which they
                                                say could be repurposed for military use – and rejected, due to x-ray
                                                imaging picking up their seeds as suspicious objects.</p>

                                            <p>Of course dates are not the only food Palestinians in Gaza are lacking
                                                this Holy Month. After five months of war leading to extensive
                                                destruction of food production, and the obstruction of aid delivery,
                                                there
                                                is barely any food at all. The emotional pain of being unable to mark
                                                Ramadan is one thing. But the physical, material lack of food for
                                                Muslims and all Palestinians across Gaza is leading to children being
                                                starved, and the entire population facing famine.</p>


                                            <p>Five months into this war, conditions to provide food to children in Gaza
                                                are getting worse . According to UN data, the daily average number of
                                                aid trucks entering Gaza dropped by more than a third in the weeks
                                                following the provisional measures by the International Court of Justice
                                                (ICJ). One of the ICJ’s rulings was that the
                                                Government of Israel allows safe, unfettered humanitarian aid access. Of
                                                course, this is also a legal obligation under International Humanitarian
                                                Law.</p>

                                            <p>At least 23 children in Gaza have now died due to
                                                malnutrition and deyhdration, according
                                                to Ministry of Health reports. This figure is climbing , and only
                                                reflects those who have made it to Gaza’s barely functioning health
                                                facilities. With services hanging by a thread, fuel scarce and roads
                                                destroyed, the real number is likely far higher.</p>

                                            <p>Data collected by the Global Nutrition Cluster – a group of aid agencies
                                                including Humanitary Relief Wave – between December and January showed almost
                                                all (90%) of children under the age of two in severe food poverty,
                                                having eaten two or less food groups in 24 hours. The same report found
                                                one in six children in northern Gaza acutely malnourished. Again, this
                                                is the tip of the iceberg. This data was collected two months
                                                ago, and since then, the crisis has plunged to abominable depths. One
                                                colleague told me: “We are waiting the long wait to death.”</p>

                                            <p>Even in Rafah - the only place left in Gaza where services are partially
                                                functioning – there are just three bakeries still open, with queues for
                                                miles. The number of goats sold at the market has reduced by a
                                                third in just a few weeks.</p>

                                            <p>Food that used to cost less like hummus, falafel, and pickles have all
                                                skyrocketed in price: colleagues in Rafah tell me that what you used to
                                                be able to buy for 30 shekels ($8 USD) will now set you back as
                                                much as $100 USD. Even the price of vegetables is now eight times what
                                                it was before the war.  People just cook what they can afford – usually
                                                with no protein.</p>

                                            <p>Families are unable to gather in the evenings as they would usually do at
                                                this time of year, with bombardments at night stopping them leaving
                                                their homes – or the tents that hundreds of thousands are now living
                                                in. A colleague told me: “It is sad how all our Ramadan memories are now
                                                squeezed into a tent.”</p>

                                            <p>And of course, the 1.5 million people who now call this area their home –
                                                most of them having been forced from their actual homes in northern Gaza
                                                – are now bracing for intensified bombing, even a ground incursion,
                                                by Israeli forces. A colleague told me: “We are telling you in advance
                                                that something very terrible is about to happen. Now is the time to act
                                                or we will die.”</p>

                                            <p>Children bear the brunt of all disasters: war, earthquakes, climate
                                                change.  When humanitarian crises coincide with Ramadan, Save the
                                                Children and other agencies work to meet community’s needs and provide
                                                meals
                                                and tents for iftars. This year, we cannot even provide a single date. 
                                                And while on one side of the border, trucks queue for miles, on the
                                                other side, children starve.</p>

                                            <p>While Ramadan should be a reminder of our shared humanity, this Holy
                                                Month we are seeing the heights of inhumanity. The international
                                                community also has a responsibility to show humanity – to put a stop to
                                                this
                                                war and to save the lives of children and families in Gaza.</p>

                                            <p>All efforts to provide more aid into Gaza are welcome. But air drops of
                                                aid or maritime initiatives are not the solutions needed to keep
                                                children alive. There are murmurings of a “temporary pause” - no doubt
                                                this will provide momentary relief for children in Gaza. But the
                                                withholding of food during Ramadan is only supposed to be during
                                                daylight hours. It is peace that is meant to last. This Ramadan in Gaza,
                                                things are the wrong way round.</p>

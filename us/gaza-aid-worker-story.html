                                                    based in
                                                    Amman, Jordan.</em></p>

                                            <p>On my first day in Rafah, Gaza, my colleague Hawa*’s mother had a stroke.
                                                With no ambulance available, her mother was driven to a partially
                                                functioning hospital. She died two days later. “The sadness from this
                                                war killed her,” Hawa later told me.</p>

                                            <p>I arrived in Gaza with Save the
                                                Children - as part of a convoy of paediatricians, surgeons, and fellow
                                                aid workers – to support children
                                                affected by the growing humanitarian catastrophe. Nothing could
                                                prepare us for what we’d witness.</p>

                                            <p>Of course, our Palestinian colleagues, like Hawa, have long been
                                                tirelessly serving their communities, even amidst personal tragedy. </p>

                                according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.</p>

                            <p>Israeli airstrikes have killed doctors, nurses, teachers and humanitarian workers.</p>

                            <p>All at a time when needs have never been higher.</p>

                            <p><strong>‘Trying to stay alive’</strong></p>

                            <p>The scenes I witnessed in Rafah will stay with me forever. The small city, home to
                                275,000 people before the war, is now housing an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians, the
                                majority of whom are women and children.</p>

                            <p>Drones are constantly flying overhead, their relentless buzzing a grim
                                reminder of the threat to children</a>. When the humming gets closer, an explosion
                                rattles the streets, usually no less than a few kilometres away.</p>

                            <p>The sheer number of children wandering the streets was overwhelming, almost apocalyptic.
                                Children with no shoes, visibly malnourished and often alone.</p>

                            <p>As of February, at least 17,000 children in Gaza were unaccompanied or separated,
                                according to UNICEF. That figure is likely far higher now. Doctors were even forced to
                                coin a depressing new term to identify them in hospital
                                – “WCNSF” Wounded Child, No Surviving Family.</p>

                            <p>Diseases and infections are also spreading rapidly. But with limited time and resources,
                                healthcare professionals are rarely able to give formal diagnoses.</p>

                            <p>At a mobile hospital, I saw children with rashes, many experiencing vomiting and
                                suffering from bloody diarrhoea. “We’re seeing scabies, lice and hepatitis,” said one
                                doctor.</p>

                            <p>Beyond disease, the life-changing wounds are impossible to miss.</p>

                            <p>&quot;We even treated a pregnant woman with a gunshot wound to her stomach,&quot; one
                                doctor shared. </p>


                            <p>I met one boy, no older than 12, pushing his younger sibling in a wheelchair. The small
                                child was visibly dirty, wearing ripped clothes and missing a leg - one of the <u>more
                                    than 1,000 children who’ve lost one or more limb since the
                                    start of the war</u> according
                                to UNICEF, as of December.</p>

                            <p>They were going “nowhere,” he explained - schools
                                have been closed or destroyed since October.</p>

                            <p>Children in Gaza spend their days trying to stay alive, sheltering from bombardment or
                                searching for food and water. One group of children, playing with an old plastic bag,
                                begged for food, or “even a football” to pass the
                                time. </p>

                            <p>Children here face a bleak reality of malnutrition,
                                disease, and despair - if not death.</p>

                            <p><strong>Too dangerous to get food</strong></p>

                            <p>“So many people have been killed, we do not even get a chance to mourn,” my colleague
                                Zainab* explained.</p>

                            <p>Last week, her husband made it to Rafah after being trapped in Northern Gaza. His
                                70-year-old father, who has Alzheimer's and cancer, was unable to evacuate and so he
                                stayed.</p>

                            <p>“I was forced to eat food left behind by the rats,” he revealed.</p>


                            <p>“Going out to find food was simply too dangerous,” he said, explaining how he narrowly
                                missed the deadly attack that killed <u>over 100 Palestinians desperately trying to
                                    collect
                                    flour.</u></p>

                            <p>More than 400 Palestinians have been killed and 1,300 injured by Israeli attacks while
                                trying to secure lifesaving food, medicine and other aid for their families, according
                                to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.</p>

                            <p><strong>‘There is simply no excuse’</strong></p>

                            <p>Getting aid into and around Gaza is extremely challenging, with restrictions at every
                                turn. </p>

                            <p>Historically, any aid entering must be cleared by Israel, which rejects items purportedly
                                deemed to have potential &quot;dual use&quot;—whether civilian or military.</p>

                            <p>In recent weeks, we’ve seen entire trucks being turned away under this rule for
                                transporting items as small as a pack of dates or a pair of scissors. Even when aid
                                manages to reach Gaza, challenges persist: there's a scarcity
                                of fuel, heightened risks, and insufficient safety assurances for the aid workers
                                responsible for its delivery.</p>

                            <p>There is simply no excuse for the shockingly inadequate levels aid in Gaza. We need to
                                see much more aid getting in much quicker – and most of all we need an immediate and
                                permanent ceasefire.        </p>

                            <p><strong>Time has run out</strong></p>


                            <p>Before October 7th, around 80% of Gaza's population depended on humanitarian assistance.
                                Now, the need is greater than ever. Without a
                                ceasefire and full, unrestricted access to aid</a>, children will continue to
                                suffer.</p>


                            <p>Nearly 26,000 children – or just over two percent of Gaza’s child population - have been
                                killed or injured in Gaza in six months of a war, <u>according
                                    to Humanitary Relief Wave.</a></u></p>

                            <p>The deaths of these children are a consequence of the world's failure to protect them.
                                The international community must urgently step up its efforts—time has run out.</p>

                            <p>The only thing that will save families in Gaza now is a definitive ceasefire.  The UN
                                Security Council demanded a temporary ceasefire, but the window for its implementation -
                                the Muslim fasting period of Ramadan – passed without
                                progress. More children have paid the cost for that inaction with their lives. A
                                ceasefire must be implemented now and sustained definitively - there is no alternative.
                            </p>

                            <p>Israel's continued use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas has devastating
                                impacts on children, who are thrown harder and further by the blasts. Countries must
                                immediately cease the transfer to the parties to the
                                conflict of weapons, parts, and ammunition that pose a risk of being used to commit
                                serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law. Anything less than
                                this is not merely a failure—it's a betrayal of
                                humanity.</p>
